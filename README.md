# GITHUB ACTIONS

This has been edited on behalf of 05-1 action.

### Context

- Access information about runs, variables, jobs and much more â†’ sources of data

- We can provide all the necessary information to our workloads
  Not every context is available at every step of the job

- There are many contexts like github, env, inputs, vars, secrets, matrix etc. Fortunately, with the help of VScode Github action extension, it tells us which ones we could use.
